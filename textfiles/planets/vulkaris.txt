Vulkaris was trapped within the Warp, until the creation of the Great Rift caused both it and the Hive World Troilus to materialize within the fringes of the Imperial Gilead System.

The planet dubbed ‘Vulkaris’ follows a highly erratic orbit around the Gilead star. This dangerous ellipse brings it close to the Heartworlds, passing through their orbital trajectories, before it swings wide and out to the limits of Gilead’s gravitational pull.

Impossibly, Vulkaris still possesses a somewhat breathable atmosphere, but it carries plague upon its winds. The cities of eroded marble and rust-sheathed iron that pollute the surface of the cold world are filled with millions of mutants, the twisted corruptions of once-pure Imperial citizens. Creatures roam the rotten streets and plague-ridden forests of the world as storms spill pus from the skies. The Emperor is forgotten here, and in the place of His temples stand shrines of Grandfather Nurgle. Nurglings manifest freely amongst the faithful to the Lord of Flies as the dead rise from their shallow grave-pits.

Mutants and monsters may populate the cities, but they do not rule them. Even the daemons that lurk around the Temples of Holy Decay are but servants to a greater power on Vulkaris. With a small number of warships held in close orbit and ready to make war, the masters of the world are the XIV Legiones Astartes, heretic Space Marines of the Death Guard — and the sons of Mortarion are not content with just one world.
