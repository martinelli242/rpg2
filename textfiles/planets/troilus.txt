Troilus was a Hive World that was trapped within the Warp, until the creation of the Great Rift caused both it and the Ice World Vulkaris to materialize within the fringes of the Imperial Gilead System.

Trollius orbits at the far limits of Gilead’s gravity, a dead Hive World locked in ice. The great spires that once housed billions in excess of even Gilead Primus’s immense population stand frozen and silent. The dense ice that covers the hives resists all but the strongest and most advanced auspex scans. The few successful pict returns show the shadowed shapes of the hive dwellers fleeing in terror from some unseen horror moments before they were frozen.

Some members of the initial inspection teams reported ‘bad dreams’ after breaching attempts were made into one of the frozen hives. They have since been enjoying the ‘hospitality’ of the Inquisition, and all future survey teams are watched closely by all three of the major Ordos.
